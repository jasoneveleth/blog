# Why did I make a blog?

- I made it because it would be fun to have a blog
- I think some of the things I've learned could be useful to other people
- Trying to explain something clarifies it in a way that keeping it to yourself doesn't
- Other cool people have blogs and I want to be just like them

# What can you find on this blog?

- Computer science, math, and whatever I'm currently interested in
