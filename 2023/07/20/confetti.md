This is a featured project on my [website](/2021/07/11/website). I made it so I would better understand camera matrices and game design.

It is calculating how each confetti would fall in real-time, and thus, large amounts of confetti (or badly optimized browsers), can really slow down a machine.

The source is on [github](https://github.com/jasoneveleth/confetti).
