<h1 id="solving_the_game_of_24"><a href="#solving_the_game_of_24" class="header-anchor">Solving the Game of 24</a></h1>
<p>I was first introduced to the game by a friend at a coffee table on a Sunday. They were surprised that I&#39;d never heard of it. <a href="https://www.jasoneveleth.com/game-of-24-app/">24</a> is a mathematical game where you use basic arithmetic operations to make four numbers equal 24.</p>
<p>The premise is given 4 playing cards, race to find an expression equal to 24. So if you were given \(2\), \(3\), \(6\), \(4\), one solution is \((6-3)\times 2+4=24\). Another example is if you had \(4\), \(8\), \(1\), \(9\), one solution might be \((4\times 8)-9+1=24\). I usually take out the face cards or count them as 10.</p>
<p>However, there&#39;s lots of games where I can&#39;t find a solution. For example, \(10\), \(10\), \(10\), \(10\), is there any way to make \(24\) with that? What about \(5\), \(5\), \(5\), \(1\)? I had to know what the solution was so I set off to create an algorithm.</p>
<h2 id="the_brute_force_solution"><a href="#the_brute_force_solution" class="header-anchor">The Brute Force Solution</a></h2>
<p>My initial approach was to consider all possible arithmetic expressions &#40;the brute force approach&#41;. It&#39;s the simplest possible strategy. We just guess and check every option. It works because even an iPhone can process thousands of these expressions in a second.</p>
<p>There are 3 pieces to this. An expression will look something like this: \(x_1\circ (x_2\circ x_3) \circ x_4\), where \(\circ\) can represent any of the arithmetic operations &#40;\(+,-,\times ,\div ,\textasciicircum\)&#41;.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The \(x_i\)&#39;s can be any of the 4 numbers</p>
</li>
<li><p>We can put any of the 5 arithmetic operations in between the numbers</p>
</li>
<li><p>&#40;this is subtle&#41; we can put parenthesis around any of the operations to potentially change the value</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We tackle each of these 3 separately. To get all possible variable assignments, we know it will be all possible permutations of the numbers. There are \(4! = 4\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1= 24\) permutations for 4 elements. This is true because when you&#39;re putting the numbers in, the first place has 4 options, then in each of the universes where you chose one, there are 3 options remaining for the next place, then in all those universes there are 2, etc. Thus, we just need to list out all permutations to get all the \(x_i\)&#39;s assigned to all numbers.</p>
<p>To get all possible choices of operators, it&#39;s even simpler: we have 5 options for the first operator spot, then 5 options again, and another 5 options again. So, \(125\) possible options.</p>
<p>The parentheses one is trickier. The way I approached this problem is you can draw out the order of operations in a tree:</p>
<div class="im-most"><img src="/blog/assets/subtraction_tree.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>A tree diagram unambiguously tells you how to calculate an expression, in the same way that parenthesis does. If you saw \(5-1-10-10\) there&#39;s a way to parenthesize this to get \(24\): \(5-(1-10-10)\), but if you did it in the PEMDAS left-to-right you&#39;d get \(-16\). We need that specificity to express all of the options.</p>
<div class="im-full"><img src="/blog/assets/tree_shapes.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>There are only 5 tree base shapes<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fndef:1" class="fnref">[1]</a></sup> &#40;I&#39;ve included a brief proof in the footnotes&#41;. It may also be intuitive that these are the only tree shapes you can make. Regardless, if we look at every option for all 3 of these aspects of arithmetic expression we get \(15,000\) total trees, and a straightforward way to list them all out.</p>
<p>In the code this ends up playing out like the snippet below. You loop through every permutation for 4 elements, every list of 3 operations, and every tree type and use that to construct a tree.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">for &#40;const perm of permutations&#40;4&#41;&#41; &#123;
  for &#40;const op_list of cartesianPower&#40;ops, 3&#41;&#41; &#123;
    for &#40;const tree_type of treeTypes&#41; &#123;
      ... construct&#40;perm&#40;nums&#41;, tree_type, op_list&#41; ...
    &#125;
  &#125;
&#125;</code></pre>
<p>If you&#39;re interested in the code for how that works, the loop is in <a href="https://github.com/jasoneveleth/game-of-24-app/blob/main/src/App.jsx"><code>App.jsx</code></a> &#40;full code <a href="https://github.com/jasoneveleth/game-of-24-app">here</a>&#41;.</p>
<h2 id="what_i_discovered"><a href="#what_i_discovered" class="header-anchor">What I Discovered</a></h2>
<p>Once I coded up the solver – I could finally find the answer to if 5, 5, 5, 1 was solvable. Turns out: <a href="https://www.jasoneveleth.com/game-of-24-app/?n1&#61;5&amp;n2&#61;5&amp;n3&#61;5&amp;n4&#61;1">it is</a>&#33; I don&#39;t think if I spend half an hour could I have thought to subtract a fifth from 5 and then multiply by 5.</p>
<div class="im-most"><img src="/blog/assets/tree_of_5-5-5-1.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>Turns out there are some pretty interesting expressions that I&#39;d never have thought of. There are also a lot of numbers that don&#39;t work: like 10, 10, 10, 10. Many impossible games are all repeats, or have lots of 7s or 9s. I&#39;d guess that&#39;s because 7 and 9 don&#39;t have many divisors and they&#39;re kinda large numbers, which ends up being annoying to work with.</p>
<p>The expressions with the most values: 1, 1, 3, 8 and 1, 1, 4, 6.</p>
<p>There are 16 games with 1 solution: 1115, 1277, 1558, 1668, 2555, 2599, 3355, 3490, 3555, 4400, 5555, 5588, 5599, 5500, 6699, 6790.</p>
<p>There are only 128 games with 0 solutions &#40;out of 10,000&#41;.</p>
<h2 id="try_it_yourself"><a href="#try_it_yourself" class="header-anchor">Try It Yourself</a></h2>
<p>I encourage you to try the <a href="https://www.jasoneveleth.com/game-of-24-app/">app</a> I made. Happy puzzling.</p>
<p><table class="fndef" id="fndef:1">
    <tr>
        <td class="fndef-backref"><a href="#fnref:1">[1]</a></td>
        <td class="fndef-content">The proof for this follows. Consider at the root node the number of leaves on each subtree. There are 3 options: \((1,3)\), \((2,2)\), \((3,1)\) since there have to be 4 numbers in the tree, and at least 1 on either side. Then think about the number of subtree shapes: for 1 node, there&#39;s only the trivial tree, for 2 nodes there&#39;s only one option for how to connect it, and for 3 nodes, we can divide that into \((1,2)\) and \((2,1)\), so 2. Thus, we get 2 options for the \((1,3)\)s and 1 option for \((2,2)\) which gives us 5 total.</td>
