&#125;</code></pre> <p>Inductive step: We assume that all planar graphs with \(|V|-1\) vertices are 5 colorable. We know from the lemma that there exists at least one vertex \(w\) of degree 5 or less. We know that if it has less degree less than 5 that we instantly win because if we remove that vertex, it is 5 colorable &#40;from our inductive hypothesis&#41;. And because \(w\) has degree less than 5 it can be colored by a color that isn&#39;t in its neighbors. Thus, we can assume \(w\) has 5 neighbors.</p> <p>Now, because \(w\) has 5 neighbors, if any two of them have the same color, then we can color \(w\) the color that is missing, so we can assume that \(w\) has degree at least 5.</p> <p>To recap what we know so far: all planar graphs have at least one vertex with less than degree 5. The worst-case scenario for our proof is when it is exactly 5, and all of the neighbors have different colors. In all other cases, we win.</p> <p>Now, we label the neighbors \(v_1\) through \(v_5\) based on their colors. We look at the largest subgraph that connects to vertex \(1\) which only contains \(1\) and \(3\) colored vertices &#40;it can have other colors hanging off of it&#41;. Now, if it doesn&#39;t contain \(v_3\) then we can flip the color of each of the vertices of the subgraph &#40;i.e. every \(1\) colored vertex becomes a \(3\) colored vertex&#41;. And then we can just color \(w\) \(1\) because it will have 2 vertices of color \(3\) adjacent to it and no vertices of color \(1\) now.</p> <p>Thus, we can assume that there is an unbroken path from \(v_1\) to \(v_3\) which contains only \(1\) and \(3\) colored vertices. Now, we can apply the same exact logic to the colors \(2\) and \(4\). Thus, we only care about the case when there is an unbroken path from \(v_2\) to \(v_4\), as otherwise we can just flip the colors fo the subgraph coming from \(v_2\) to recolor \(w\) with color \(2\). However, there can&#39;t be both an unbroken path from \(v_1\) to \(v_3\) using only \(1\) and \(3\) colored vertices, <em>and</em> an unbroken path from \(v_2\) to \(v_4\) using only \(2\) and \(4\) colored vertices. The paths have to cross because they are paths on a plane. This that case leads to a contradiction, so any planar graph must&#39;ve fallen into one of the cases that was 5 colorable. Thus, every planar graph is 5 colorable. This concludes the proof.</p> <p><hr /> <script src="https://utteranc.es/client.js" repo="jasoneveleth/blog" issue-term=pathname  label=Comment  theme=github-light  crossorigin=anonymous  async> </script> </p> <div class=page-foot > Â© Jason Eveleth.
